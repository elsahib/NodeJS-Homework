# Debugging Practice

We've hosted some Servers on Glitch but they're not quite working properly. Could you fix them for us?

## Start by remixing our example server

- [ ] Make sure you're logged in to https://glitch.com/
- [ ] Remix each example
- [ ] Name your new server `yourname` + NAME_OF_EXERCISE
- [ ] Check that it is working by making a request to `/`
- [ ] Fix the code on your version of the server
